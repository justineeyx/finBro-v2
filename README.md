TEAM NAME: 
finBRO 

Level of achievement: 
Apollo 11


Motivation: 

During the period of rising inflation and the use of digital payments, tracking daily spending can be quite tough. Furthermore, many consumers are known to be impulsive buyers without thoughtful financial consideration or planning. This results in many being familiar with the feeling of disappointment after viewing their monthly bank account balance due to poor financial planning. 

So why not have a finance application that keeps track, consolidates all your expenses and categorizes all your spending so you can have a better understanding of your purchasing habits? This can be an all in one application where it can motivate users to save more, plan better. 

Aim: 

We hope to help people track their finances properly in order to reduce excessive spending and save more money for a rainy day. By reducing spending, our users can feel better about themselves at the end of each month. (eg. a mobile application) 


Project scope:

A one stop web application, where users can log in and set budget goals, input their expenses and view monthly insights of their expenses.


User Stories: 

As a student with limited spending power due to no income and unlimited wants, I want to be able to track what my money is being spent on and maximize my savings.

As a student who often studies and has my meals outside, I want to be able to track how much I spent on food and transport. 

As an adult with many different types of expenses such as paying taxes and bills, I want to know the breakdown of categories of my spending.

As an adult with many credit card bills, I want to have a history of my expenses so that I can track and match it to my credit card bill to have a peace of mind that my bill is correct.
